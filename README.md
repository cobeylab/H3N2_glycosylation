### 160 allele frequencies

### Serological analyses

All of the statistical analysis and figures involving serology are in the script `Serological_analyses.R`. 

Some of the multivariate regression models test the effects of primary exposure to the 160K allele. 
The `160K_imprinting.R` script calculates the probability of primary exposure to this alllele, and it also generates figures showing 160K allele frequencies from 1968 through 2010 and the imprinting probabilities for the birth years relevant to the study.
